### 7. HOW YOUR PERSONAL DATA IS TRANSFERRED

Mythologi operates the App across the globe. Your Personal Data will very likely be transferred and stored in a country outside of your home country according to the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy. The data protection laws in these countries may not be the same as in your home country.

If we transfer your Personal Data from the EEA to other countries, including the United States, we ensure that a similar degree of protection is provided to your Personal Data as within the EEA by ensuring that the country that your Personal Data is transferred to is a country that the European Commission has deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for Personal Data as the EEA.

Entities located overseas will use the data in compliance with the APPs, GDPR and CCPA and Mythologi will take reasonable steps to ensure they comply with the APPs, GDPR and CCPA.

### 8. HOW WE KEEP YOUR PERSONAL DATA SAFE

We have appropriate security measures in place to prevent your Personal Data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorized way, improperly altered or disclosed. We also limit access to your Personal Data to employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your Personal Data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality. We have put in place procedures to address any suspected Personal Data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.

Although Mythologi takes a range of security measures designed to protect your Personal Data, complete online and offline security can never be guaranteed, so you should always take care when sharing your information online.

A. SECURITY MEASURES AND RISK AGREEMENT

Your personal data is kept from disclosure in various ways (encryption, passwords). To protect your personal information, we take reasonable precautions and follow industry best practices to make sure it is not inappropriately lost, misused, accessed, disclosed, altered or destroyed.

If you provide us with your credit card information, the information is encrypted using secure socket layer technology (SSL) and stored with an AES-256 encryption. Although no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure, we follow all PCI-DSS requirements and implement additional generally accepted industry standards.

Except if your information is required to be retained by law, we will hold your information for as long as we require it to provide services to you, or until you notify us you no longer wish to hold your account, or for EU or California residents, until you request that we erase your data.

Personal information collected online is stored by Mythologi and/or service providers in databases protected by physical and electronic means of control, technologies of the access control system and other acceptable security measures. Despite this, such security measures cannot prevent all losses, malicious use or modification of personal data, and the Mythologi is not responsible for any damage or loss that result from such incidents.

You acknowledge, confirm and agree that the technical processing and transmission of information of the App may include the transmission of data through various networks, including via unencrypted communication channels of the Internet, which is never completely confidential and safe.

You also understand that any messages and/or information sent via Mythologi’s server may be unauthorizedly read and/or intercepted by third parties.

By using the App, you are aware and agree that the App may be subject to malfunctions and downtime due to which you may incur losses, Mythologi is not liable for any malfunction and subsequent loss of data and other consequences in case of malfunctions and downtime of the App.

By providing the data you agree to the processing, i.e. the implementation of any actions (operations) with the data provided.

You hereby consent to Mythologi’s provision of the transferred information to third parties, including those supporting our services, in the quantity necessary for such support and/or other persons; rights and responsibilities for access to relevant information are established by applicable law.

Your consent to the processing of the data provided is valid for an indefinite period and shall remain in effect until the time of its withdrawal in writing. Mythologi undertakes to terminate the processing of data in a reasonable time after receiving the relevant request.

1. HOW LONG WE WILL KEEP YOUR PERSONAL DATA

We keep your Personal Data for as long as we need to provide the App to you and fulfill the provisions of this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use, as well as to comply with applicable law. This is also the case for anyone that we share your information with and who carry out services on our behalf.

When we no longer need to use your Personal Data and there is no need for us to keep it to comply with our legal or regulatory obligations, we will either remove it from our systems or anonymize it so that it can no longer be associated with you.

When removing Personal Data, we will take commercially reasonable and technically feasible measures to make the Personal Data irrecoverable or irreproducible.

### 11. CHILDREN

Users who are minors can use the App only if their parent or guardian has consented to their use of the App.

If a parent or guardian no longer consents to a minor’s access to or use of the App, the parent or guardian should delete the minor’s App account by contacting [support@mythologi.es](mailto:support@mythologi.es) , providing the email account details to request removal, and should delete the App by following the instructions of the App store from which the App was downloaded.

As contrasted with minors, who are individuals under the age of majority in their jurisdiction, we define “children” as follows:

Residents of the EEA: anyone under 16 years old, or the age needed to consent to the processing of personal data in your country of residence.

Residents of other regions: anyone under 13 years old.

Mythologi does not knowingly collect or store any Personal Data from children under 13 in the United States or under the relevant age threshold in other jurisdictions where the child is located. However, we may collect technical information required for delivering the App and for the support of our internal operations from all users of the App, including collection of persistent identifiers to authenticate users of the App. If parents believe that we have unintentionally collected their children’s Personal Data or otherwise used their children’s Personal Data for another purpose, they may contact us by emailing [support@mythologi.es](mailto:support@mythologi.es) or sending written communication to 512-5333 avenue Casgrain, Montreal QC, Canada H2T 1X3

We recognize a special need to protect the personal information of children. We urge parents to instruct their children to never give out their real names, addresses, phone numbers, or other personal information without parental permission, when online. Mythologi also recommends that parents familiarize themselves with parental controls available on mobile telephones, tablets and other devices they provide to their child and accompany their child when online. Parents should contact Mythologi immediately if they have any concerns.

Parents have the right to review their child’s Personal Data; to have their child’s Personal Data deleted; and to refuse further collection, use, and/or disclosure of their child’s Personal Data by notifying us. If we learn that we have collected Personal Data of a child, and we do not have parental consent, we will take steps to delete such information from our files as soon as possible.

If you have questions about our privacy practices for children, please contact us at [support@mythologi.es](mailto:support@mythologi.es) or 512-5333 avenue Casgrain, Montreal Quebec, Canada H2T 1X3.

### 12. CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY

Mythologi is constantly improving ways of collecting, storing and processing data, including the Privacy Policy. Any Personal Data that we collect is covered by the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is collected. We may make changes to this Privacy Policy from time to time. You will be given reasonable notice of any material change.

The continued use of the App after making such changes confirms your agreement with such changes.

We are not responsible for the content, privacy, or security practices and policies of any Third Party Service.
