# Introducing Elysium

**Powered by Presence. Design Meaning. Play Together.**

## Overview

ELYSIUM is a new paradigm for creating immersive digital experiences in the real world.

It is a creation toolkit and a cloud platform that allows anyone to build their own worlds in agumented reality in real-time and share it with others.

Through our unique system of no-code interactive tools, all users become creators in their own right, and can build worlds that tell _their_ story through interactive journeys in real spaces and locations. Beyond establishing connections, our interaction design engine: the GEIST Engine, allows you to create _relationships_ between people, places, the digital, and activity.

As you create, you will see exactly what your audience will see. And as you build, your experience can be instantly published to be shared.

A What-you-see-is-what-you-get (WYSIWYG) editor for the Spatial Web.

## What is AR?

Augmented Reality (AR) is actually an entire series of technologies that allows for the illusion of placing a digital asset on top of the percieved real world.

You are likely exposed to AR everyday without knowing it. One form of AR powers the face filters we commonly see on social media. What the technology is doing is overlaying a digital effect on a tracked element (in this case your face) and puts them together as a video image.

## What can you do with AR?

Just as AR has many forms, it has an even larger breadth of uses.

Depending on the kind of AR being implemented, the specific combinations of individual technologies in place, and the delivery of those technologies as an experience, AR has the capacity to add to anything we do that involves people and connectivity.

## What is Elysium?

The next-gen AR worldbuilding tool and platform for the next evolution of connectivity and engagement.

No-code, Geolocated, time Persistent, Real-time… All this comes together in ELYSIUM to allow anyone to build immersive journeys, on location, in any location, in an intuitive and simple manner that is powered by your presence and Share it within an Audience all in one App

## Key Concepts

### Worldbuilding as storytelling

We believe that by building narratives and creating worlds, communities can become more closely connected. In Elysium, the potential is limitless to create, share and strengthen location-based bonds through the stories that are told by the use of AR.

### Who is it for?

Elysium is for anyone and everyone who is curious about the potentials of geo-located AR.

Whether you’re an artist who wants to install and promote their work in AR, a business who wants to expand the ways their product is marketed locally and globally, an educational institution that wants to explore new avenues for students to learn, or someone who just loves to play, Elysium has something for everyone.

### Players

Players can explore and interact with the scenes and worlds built by creators. In Player-Mode, Players can locate AR scenes made by creators in any location via our in-app map. Once you’ve found a world or scene you wish to explore, simply click on that location and use Elysium to explore the world around you.

### Creators

Creators can use assets in their library to build worlds and scenes in any geo-located area. Creators also have the ability to upload their own virtual assets and place them into their scenes. These scenes are chosen based on the user’s current location, and can be built within the range specified by the creator using locative pin-points. Once the scenes have been published, they can be seen and interacted with by players and creators alike.

### Creator Network

We want creators to be able to freely seek and share knowledge with one another. Via Elysium’s Creator Community Discord channel, creators can assemble and build a community around a shared love of AR, learning from eachother about the best ways to use the app. Users can join the Discord channel by [clicking here](https://discord.com/invite/gYMKNYHJRJ).

### Interactive features

Elysium offers a wealth of interactive features, with new ways of making the experience more communal and immersive being developed regularly. The main interactive features Elysium currently hosts are as follows:

- Drag and drop placement: To make building worlds as intuitive as possible, Elysium allows for creators to set up their scenes by simply dragging assets from their libraries and easily placing them in exact locations made visible through the camera of their devices.
- Immersive 3D assets: Once a 3D asset has been placed in a location, players and creators can re-size, re-place, and engage with the object as if it was tangibly in the space with them.
- Directional-Spatial Audio: Audio assets can also be placed in exact locations, similar to 3D assets. These assets allow players to change the volume and direction of the sound based on their proximity to the asset.
- Interoperability: Elysium allows digital assets to be integrated with external hardware, so that the press of a virtual button can have physical reactions. For example, a virtual asset which is connected to a lightbulb can be pressed to turn the light on and off.

### Interoperability

Interoperability is currently being integrated as a major interactive feature of Elysium. With the desire to develop the real-world possibilites of AR, our team has been developing an integrated system between asset and hardware. With this feature, digital assets placed in Elysium can be linked to physical electronic devices to trigger responses from this hardware using only digital actuators.

### Android / iOS

Currently, Elysium can only be hosted on iOS devices, however our team is working hard to expand the reach of our software so that Elysium can function on a wide variety of operating systems.
