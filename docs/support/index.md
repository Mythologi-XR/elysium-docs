# Contact us

We have lots of ways for you to get support and inspiration from our team and our growing community of creators.

## Discord

Elysium aims to build a strong network of creators and players alike, so that community knowledge can be shared freely amongst our users. One of the ways weâ€™ve built this community is by hosting the Elysium Discord server, where members can access the latest development information and FAQ, share their creations with other users, and participate in virtual events and workshops.

Join us on the public [Elysium Discord Server](https://discord.gg/gYMKNYHJRJ) to chat with the team and other Elysium users.
