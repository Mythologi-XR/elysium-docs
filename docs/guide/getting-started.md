# Getting Started

Elysium is a free app for building and exploring AR worlds. It allows you to place 2D, 3D and multimedia content in physical environments and associate them with markers so they will always appear exacly as you place them for anyone that visits your scenes. The app has powerful features for building rich experiences, but it's easy to get started!
